f001,KevineN,1,6/30/2025 21:17,0,always late incompetent idiots
f002,Tobias Alm,1,6/30/2025 13:40,0,It works to blip with the mobile (not cracked screen) 1/5 times.Had driven with cards but it costs money for the plastic card itself.Pretty boring if you just have it for the summer card.
f003,Александр «al1k» Старостин,1,6/25/2025 11:20,0,can't register phone number can't pay without the number
f004,Jaume Adrover Forteza,1,6/19/2025 0:53,0,"The trains and buses are delayed or have some problem almost daily. The prices are way too high and make no sense. Even the app does funny things every few months. Sincerely, they only stay in business because they have monopoly."
f005,Teemu Jäntti,4,6/11/2025 5:11,0,Not bad at all. Great addition would be a widget that shows you directly the QR code of your chosen ticket.
f006,Simon,1,5/30/2025 11:35,0,A bug in the payment solution prevents me from paying by card.
f007,Aleksandr Gruzintsev,5,5/23/2025 9:56,3,"Very convenient app overall. Great job! The only bug(?) that irritates me a lot is the unpersonalized search. Scenario: I live in Malmö and never been in Ystad. I'm currently staying somewhere in Malmö and searching for the fastest way to Regementsgatan in the app (as I did previously many times), and the app suggests me a street with the same name in Ystad first."
f008,martin martin,1,4/28/2025 21:21,0,buss did not come
f009,[;',5,4/25/2025 19:02,0,Good and simple app with good features for those who want.Even better now with the new function to be able to see all departures (incl. Live) from a certain stop.
f010,Maxim Paymushkin,5,4/17/2025 15:29,2,"Please rectify the error with bus line 130. When looking for a trip from Lund Bankgatan to Malmö Värnhem, only buses from line 131 are displayed. There are also some strange alternatives with routes that are 2-3 km away, but not a single by bus 130."
f011,Marcelo Aguiar,3,4/15/2025 9:03,1,"Getting better, but last update made the live traffic function less usable. Now the app never remembers which bus I chose, so I have to select it every time I use it. Not so quick and practical anymore."
f012,{Debasis & Chayanika}Sarbajna,5,4/10/2025 7:41,0,wonderful
f013,Accede'To Vegan Drivers Rodnry Zaxxs Af Vegan,5,3/17/2025 22:54,0,"Excellente ,, Good for the climate , great staff , lots of information about schedules and delays , take time to learn but beats sitting in a car waiting for traffic"
f014,Frank,5,3/5/2025 17:23,0,Really najs💪
f015,Shell Uzo,1,3/1/2025 9:56,0,"When I have one or two bus replacements, I have to search for each exchange for each change because the entire search from the beginning only shows a exchange option while it is in reality possible to choose 2-3 buses most often.So you could have made the app smarter and show all possible changes.This is because you usually get fam to exchange bus stop earlier or later than scheduled time."
f016,Robert Adamson,1,1/30/2025 12:28,12,"Not showing correct departure time. When trains are delayed the information is shown to late, you have no chance to take an earlier train."
f017,Patrik Niklasson,5,1/23/2025 8:58,0,No issues so far!
f018,Liz,1,1/15/2025 8:30,1,"It sucks like really bad.... The workers are arrogant about everything when you ACCIDENTALLY push them (YES ACCIDENTALLY ITS SO BAD.. not everyone is like this luckily) and the trains are always so late and it's always construction on the ride or something, learn to do better cause this is useless. Apologized one time to one of the workers after accidentally pushing them AND THEY KEPT SPEAKING?? KEEP IT TO YOURSELF, I DON'T WANNA HEAR YO PROBLEMS ABOUT PEOPLE RIDING THE TRAINS...?? Embarrassing."
f019,Angel Rodriguez,4,12/28/2024 22:18,2,Generally works fine
f020,Albert Backenhof,5,12/18/2024 22:08,6,"It's ok for what it is supposed to do. Now please make it more user-friendly. For instance, add notification when long time ticket expires and make it possible to renew on long press. Update: this got fixed promptly, unlike my review"
f021,Kenneth Eriksson,2,11/19/2024 9:43,1,"A little sneaky that the ""Activate Now"" button is in exactly the same place as ""OK"" after purchase.You are welcome to do that better."
f022,carrorune,3,11/13/2024 11:56,2,"How come you still haven't fixed that you can see all departures from a stop?Not even when I turn on ""nearby stops"", both buses (which depart from the same stop) do.Extremely frustrating not to be able to plan their trip properly !!After trying almost all public transport apps, this is still the best.This and that you can see the buses in real time is the only reason there will be 3 stars."
f023,Morten Østerlund Jørgensen,1,10/30/2024 18:17,0,Extremely lazy staff. They don't want to check tickets and just walk very fast through the train
f024,Aubrey Dilson,3,10/21/2024 8:01,1,I'm not sure where I can comment about the busses and not the app but the buss drivers never wait for you even when it's 1 second. I get they want to be on time but waiting a second should not be a big problem otherwise I think the app is very good when it comes to directions.
f025,Alessio Curri,1,10/14/2024 22:47,2,Why do you need my mobile number to be able to buy a train ticket? Spam much?
f026,Thomas N,1,10/11/2024 14:51,0,Scan QR code very often fails in the buses.Why not use NFC!🤦vir
f027,Andrea Villalobos,4,10/9/2024 12:14,1,"The best cost/benefit way to take public transport in the Scandinavian region. So just needs to improve in the options of moving in the map, especially in the walking way part."
f028,Clara D'Andrea,1,9/26/2024 21:53,0,"I only gave this app one star cuz I dont know how to give it a half.... if i could give it minus, I would. Lol just got back here to give it 1 star again cuz I forgot i already gave it"
f029,Christian Gylling,1,9/22/2024 15:11,1,"Can't buy a ticket, tough, lots of error messages.Customer service had no solution."
f030,Dilshan Weerathunga,4,9/1/2024 19:30,1,"My first impression of the app isn’t good because there’s no bottom navigation bar or hamburger menu. When I press the device's back button, a location selection alert appears instead. I think this needs to be changed."
f031,Niloofar Asadi zaki,1,8/5/2024 13:04,0,"When I tried to register my number I got the below error message: Oops, something went wrong! Contact customer service for more information."
f032,Vincent Videve,1,8/1/2024 23:18,0,Nothing wrong with the app but Skånetrafiken can pull somewhere
f033,2H2,2,7/5/2024 12:15,0,Mid
f034,Adam Nadolny,5,6/4/2024 18:06,2,"Great app, first time in Malmö and this app was really helpful for commuting from start to finish of my trip (CPH airport to Malmo and around the city). Thanks!"
f035,Jace,1,5/23/2024 15:49,1,"Not only does the app not say when the transportation is late or even cancelled, but it also doesn't accurately depict the best course of action to get from point A to point B. You just gotta pray you get a good driver or the buss won't even pick you up at the stops outside town."
f036,Mauricio Marin Jimenez,1,5/20/2024 8:20,0,It gets dumber and dumber with each update
f037,Anders Blomdell,1,4/8/2024 13:09,0,"Almost never can to scan the ticket on buses, perhaps because of too small QR code"
f038,Ludvig Mäki,1,3/30/2024 9:43,0,Can't buy a ticket.States that you have to be 18 years old.Stands that you can pay when you are 7-18 years ...
f039,Sara Bearnaise,2,3/18/2024 12:54,0,"Fit with the ticket on the phone, the app is something better at searching for trips with many changes than before.Sad to have to seek information about delays through the Swedish Transport Administration if you want correct info, Skånetrafiken's app/web rarely shows right.I get notification when the monthly ticket expires but not for the trips I follow.When I want to follow an event in the app, I get a message ""Null/Nnull"".The app is allowed to send all notes, even when the phone is in disturbing no position, does not work."
f040,Marcus Holmström,1,3/13/2024 7:57,0,"The worst public transport company in Sweden.Be careful and seek each sub -trip separately, otherwise incorrect suggestions will send you in the wrong direction.Otherwise, the fare is constantly increasing, bus lines are withdrawn and departures become fewer and fewer, especially outside big cities.Skånetrafiken does not deserve tax assets to finance its failed business."
f041,hasuchobogosu,1,2/20/2024 19:14,3,Is not accurate with delays. Will change time even if there is no delay then won't correct it until after it departed. Besides that really all Skånetrafikens services are at best a 2/10 and the prices are outrageous considering it's all paid by taxpayers.
f042,David,1,2/4/2024 14:07,0,"The ticket system is disastrously lousy and it is clear that Skånetrafiken is only trying to make more and more money on public transport.Tickets will be more expensive, the bus chafs will be unpleasant and both buses and trains are only more delayed."
f043,Tage Henningsson,4,1/29/2024 8:49,1,"Good for getting around if one needs, better than Blekinges"
f044,Chris Johansson,4,1/22/2024 8:50,1,"What did you do with the filtering in the search?Finding all options for commuting between Malmö and Helsingborg is no longer going.There are both Pågatåg and Öresund train that go to the same destinations but you filter one or the other?Where is the option that gives me both the fastest train and the trains that happen to take 5min longer?Fix your search results, filters are a choice not a preset and you set something so set to show everything.Thanks for the fix, now works :)"
f045,jo ke,2,1/19/2024 14:40,1,"I travell between Höör and Malmö and have lost half of my train options since the new time table came in December 2023. I have changed the filter when searching in the app but I still only get half of the available train departures. Pls fix! Hi Linus, thanks for the reply! It seems like the issues is fixed from Höör >> Malmö. But not the other way around. Could you please look into it? Thanks!"
f046,Robin Karlsson,1,1/2/2024 17:46,4,"Terribly designed app. I bought a ticket for a specific time and then a pop up asks me immediately after purchase if I want to activate my ticket, doing so invalidated it for the time I specified in the first step. Had to buy an additional ticket due to poor design."
f047,Anna Erdei,1,12/20/2023 15:55,0,"I have an Android 10. The qr code for tickets is too small and cannot be scanned on board. Every time I board the bus i have to explain that it is actually a valid ticket. Super annoying, every other app works on my phone except this."
f048,Krzysztof Zimmermann,1,12/15/2023 12:47,0,Incredibly messy and unreliable
f049,Rebecca Rose,2,11/21/2023 22:22,0,"Sooo is there going to be an update to fix the issues caused by the latest update? Before I could plan my journey in one step and it would show me the bus, train and bus I need to take. Now if I put in my usual journey it says to walk 1.5 km, take a train and then walk another 2km. So now I have to create three separate searches to find out how to get there."
f050,Addis,1,11/20/2023 17:06,0,Seems to be impossible for the trains to arrive on time.
f051,Dave Newell,1,11/13/2023 0:29,0,"Terrible service, trains always cancelled, rude staff, scammers."
f052,kazi azmery,5,11/11/2023 15:47,1,Good recommended
f053,Marius P.,5,11/5/2023 16:34,1,Works great!
f054,Pial Rahman,1,11/2/2023 13:30,0,"Would buy a ticket but the payment process hung, restart, the same thing again.The third time the app worked, however, three tickets had been purchased.When I discovered this, I did not receive a refund of SEK 428 for the two unactivated tickets when, according to customer service, I did not call the same day the tickets were purchased (did not notice the purchases at first).The hassle of the app hanging in payment processing is not uncommon for the app, sad that customers stand for your app not working properly."
f055,Martin Pedersen,4,10/31/2023 16:38,1,"Good, not great! Apparat from the occasional hickup with payments and confusing instructions when a bus is re-routed it works really well. I am missing the congestion indicators though. Sad to see them go."
f056,Mathias Svensson,4,10/29/2023 22:08,1,It's way too easy to accidentally activate a ticket right after purchased. I also wished I got a notification as a reminder when my flex 10/30 ticket is about to expire.
f057,Per He,3,10/27/2023 22:11,1,"Ok app.Would have been better to see an overview of the trip including the selected travel cloth, the time and the destination so that you press the pay button with a little extra peace and quiet and be assured that everything is right."
f058,Jan Elmlund,1,9/23/2023 12:06,9,"Hi, I would like to go between Malmö C and Malmö Drottningtorget.Skånetrafiken: Yes, you first have to take the bus to Kiruna, where you can switch to Snömobil and then go 30km to a train that is set (but it is the Swedish Transport Administration's fault) so you must first navigate in Lapland's forests for 3 days to reach replacement buses.The replacement bus goes via Oslo so there is a change (4 -day waiting time).Bus 666 from Oslo to Stockholm takes about a week depending on the weather.In Stockholm you can take the flight to the Tilkaktrup"
f059,Johan Sandgren,3,9/19/2023 11:51,0,Bug.Forgets those i lent to at new monthly card
f060,Frans Rosencrantz,1,9/9/2023 10:21,0,"The bus from Höganäs to Helsingborg is always delayed, which makes you miss the trains from Knutpunkten.Fix so that your bus times are right and have better margins."
f061,Alberto Fabbri,4,8/28/2023 20:33,6,"It would be awesome if, in addition to the option of monitoring certain trips, we could save locations as in Google Maps. Especially because the app doesn't have a well implemented ""search history"" function, it always forget my home address."
f062,Brandon Plombon,1,8/25/2023 20:49,0,Garbage
f063,Alfred Deutgen,2,8/22/2023 16:09,1,"Has a new Samsung.Does not matter how you turn and turn on the phone with the highest brightness and clean screen, can never succeed.So every time I have to stop the sex until the bus the driver lets me go or I have to explain that it never scans my phone."
f064,Vernita Jones,5,8/21/2023 18:08,0,"Best travel app I've used in Sweden. Thank you for switching the activation to after purchase, has saved me a few times!"
f065,e chilling,5,8/18/2023 13:32,0,Bra 😖:3
f066,mars merah,5,8/13/2023 6:21,0,Perfect apps to use
f067,Ferran Buireu,5,8/11/2023 14:15,0,Super easy to use and with very interesting discounts.Almost obliged to travel to Malmö and surroundings
f068,Einar Th,3,7/8/2023 15:37,1,"App is fine, the transport is awful. Bikes and baby carriages take up all the seats, the rest of the seats are either occupied or reserved. The air conditioning is good though."
f069,Mauricio Marín,1,7/4/2023 19:06,1,"When I can count well, at what time Route 3 in Malmö, I will consider raising the grade."
f070,David Sime,1,7/3/2023 12:44,1,"I must say, the recent color scheme update in the transport app has been rather disappointing. The new color choices have made everything appear indistinct and illegible, which is quite disheartening. Personally, I believe the app was much better before, when it sported a simpler palette of yellow, black, and gray (in dark mode). I hope the developers consider revisiting the previous color scheme, as it offered a more visually pleasing and user-friendly experience."
f071,Timur Sahin,1,6/20/2023 19:33,6,"You need to verify a phone number to use the app, but you never get the text. I entered three different phone numbers, with and without the country code, and none of them got the text. Finally gave up."
f072,Knut Hörberg,1,6/13/2023 13:33,0,"Works, but has a ton of annoyances."
f073,Erik Bjäreholt,5,6/5/2023 9:54,0,On the way to a better app.Now just fix what people whine about (English in the app I would consider most important) so it will be really good in the end.Edit: Now damn good.Others can learn some.
f074,Tonali Kolar,1,5/14/2023 19:35,0,Worst transport company in Sweden.Always delayed and no one cares about you as a customer.A half star is too much for this lousy company.
f075,Logga Ut,1,5/7/2023 1:43,0,"Wish I could give this service a minus. I'm ashamed to be Swedish, that's how disappointing Skånetrafiken is EVERY GODDAMN DAY. If you love paying 25€ to get dissapointed and having to dish out another 100€ for an uber just to get home any day of the week then Skånetrafiken is the service for you!"
f076,Rik Bouwmeester,1,4/28/2023 10:37,0,"Used to work very well, now with failing purchases get ready to miss all your trains"
f077,Jimmy Erixon,1,4/7/2023 11:40,0,"It's like the actual traffic, nothing works. And why does my virusapp detect malware from this app?!"
f078,Tobias,1,3/29/2023 7:01,0,Unable to take screenshots in the app.Do not update when there is a track change (worked in the previous app) compulsion on updating the app to buy a ticket.
f079,Ivana Vukelic,2,3/22/2023 7:52,0,"Terrible issues with adding payment card, it simply doesn't work."
f080,Julio Ulloa,1,3/1/2023 8:32,1,There is no feedback option. No way to express dalayed or missconducts in the busses. No help by calling customer service. Reviwed almost a year ago. No updates.
f081,Enjoy Football,1,2/16/2023 7:47,0,Scam! I bough the ticket for 1 month 1 month ago for 555 kr and nor it's 624 kr!
f082,Paul Malmheden,4,2/3/2023 13:51,1,"Works well now after latest update. Still more payment options would be nice. Googlepay etc Edit: bought a pixel 6a and you need to activate Dark mode and Extra Dim, as well as hold the phone ca 2cm from the reader to get successful in 8-9/10 tries, indicating light level as a potential cause. Good response from support!"
f083,Daniel Runemalm,2,1/30/2023 20:03,0,I really like this app and it has many good features and interfaces.The reason for the low grade is that after the last big update a couple of months ago you did about the search algorithm and now I can no longer see my entire trip within the City of Malmö on a search that I could before.I now have to do a search on city bus and a new search on Pågatåg.Very frustrating!Hope you will rectify this very soon.
f084,Charlie Jonasson,5,1/16/2023 1:48,0,cheaper prices
f085,Dan Zamora,4,12/30/2022 11:13,0,App worked great during the time we were in Malmö. Searching for routes was easy with all the relevant time and information. Do wish there was more payment options like Google pay or samsung pay. Overall it worked as expected.
f086,Raprasor Sy,5,12/27/2022 11:45,0,Brilliant App. Can see real time bus locations. Very usefull.
f087,Janne Hako,1,12/17/2022 9:22,2,Even a monkey would be able to arrange better service than Skånetrafiken.
f088,Måns Leifsson,5,12/16/2022 18:23,1,"Edit: The points I raised are now fixed.Thanks for that.Please do not change the bus table if the bus is late.If it caught up with time, you will be late to the stop.Instead, put a warning.The old app had very clear where the tables were easier to use.Something that needs to be done is to add the times to the intermediate stations when checking a bus ride.That being said, the new app has much more potential, but so far it is far from as good as the old one."
f089,Daniel Thursfield,4,12/14/2022 10:10,0,Works well and the opportunity to share a ticket is fantastic!
f090,Jesper Svensson,2,12/9/2022 22:31,0,"Switch on/off full brightness has no effect, always full. Scanner on the bus is so bad with Google pixel that I simply gave up a few times."
f091,John Traas,1,12/8/2022 16:44,1,"Awful recent updating to the search logic. Most searches turn up no results now. 'My Location' no longer works, trying to search from a local bus stop to another station returns zero results if you don't narrow the search down to the correct departure time, whereas it used to provide all upcoming options. Whatever the most recent updates to the search functionality were, it is massively broken and now provides an awful user experience."
f092,Siriginidi S Rao,5,11/30/2022 21:54,0,Very good and user friendly app
f093,THE HOGE REVIEWER,1,11/29/2022 13:58,0,Horungar ... expensive tickets delayed trains/buses ... worthless company (monopoly)
f094,Max Power,1,11/22/2022 8:45,1,"Unfortunately not suited for travelers. It used to be impossible to sign up with a foreign mobile number, now it is impossible to sign up with an international debit/credit card due to the terrible service of Swedbank. Do I really have to use the Trainline App instead because you are incapable of reaching international standards? I believe Sweden can do better!"
f095,Ertugrul Ciltik,4,11/17/2022 4:05,1,"Problems with the app today. When searching for location of station or bus it says, I might have an unsecure internet connection or wrong clock timer or try and update app. After reinstalling app I can no longer log on. At log in it says that there is no communication to the app. Fix pls."
f096,Hannes Samuelsson,5,11/12/2022 14:31,0,Works well.Better than other public transport in Sweden.
f097,Benic Pin,2,11/11/2022 9:20,0,Cannot buy ticket with credit card for the last 2 weeks!
f098,Lola Ruzikulova,3,11/7/2022 13:23,2,"Major issues with ticket purchase. Please, solve the technical problem. Reinstalling didn't help, as well as chatting with skanetrafiken and bank employees. In general, the application is really user friendly, handy and easy to use. But lately I have been experiencing problems with payment. I can't purchase a new ticket as every time I try, the application tells me that there is some problem and I should try doing it later. Doing it later - didn't help, as well as reinstalling the application."
f099,Mikkel Lind,1,11/5/2022 14:23,0,It's wrong with your app.It sometimes shows the wrong time even if you activated the ticket correctly.You are the worst.Worthless customer support with.Cannot communicate for a penny.Scam company stay away.5/11/22.You still have not fixed any problems but rather become worse.The app often shows the wrong times or the wrong track and there is so much problem with the app that it is not always possible to buy a ticket.Will be forced to buy a car.
f100,Johanna Moss,5,11/1/2022 12:24,0,Amazing app
f101,Sándor Deák,3,10/28/2022 13:41,1,"Can't buy ticket with foreign phone number. Sms not received. UPDATE: have received the sms after a couple of hours, and managed to buy tickets later."
f102,Ericson Francisko,1,10/27/2022 19:33,0,"Unreliable app with unresolved issues and in need of optimisation. Issues 1. if you have wifi turned on (but arent connected to it) your ticket will show as invalid 2. some kind of quick button to quickly just open the ticket for scaning would be more than welcome... right now you have to open the app, you get asked to turn on gps, need to press no thank you, press ticket tab.. etc I cant believe developer didnt think of adding a button that would present currently valid ticket with 1 click"
f103,Magnus Göransson,1,10/23/2022 21:33,0,"The app does not send any activation code to my Icelandic mobile number.Thus, I cannot buy any ticket.Can you fix so that the app works with foreign mobiles as well?"
f104,Gustaf,4,10/2/2022 11:41,3,Good but bug: Payment of 24 hrs ticket (student) grayed out when language set to English. Worked when set to Swedish. On Samsung Galaxy S21 with newest version (released 27th Sept)
f105,Dennis,1,9/16/2022 10:28,0,"App works fine, too bad we are cursed with having Skånetrafiken"
f106,Markus Berthilsson,1,9/7/2022 17:14,0,Real bottom company that takes no responsibility for their mistakes and punishing their customers strongly when they do something wrong.Hope it will be abolished in the near future and replaced by the private sector.
f107,Emanuel Sjödin,1,8/22/2022 6:21,0,Problems after problems with both the app and the buses/trains.
f108,ZlayerPlayer,1,8/18/2022 23:03,1,"The app is alright, but their service is horrible, good luck if you're traveling with Skånetrafiken"
f109,Ola Hindmo,3,8/14/2022 1:17,0,It's ok. Needed to have the e ticket as traffic is cash less
f110,Oskar hertzman,1,8/5/2022 11:09,0,Worst app ever
f111,Andreas Lymalm,5,8/2/2022 10:27,0,A very clean and user friendly app. I love it.
f112,Garloc,1,7/30/2022 18:51,0,Can't use it on my phone. this problem shudnt ever happen. Now I can't use my expensive buss ticket..
f113,Thomas Hallén,2,7/27/2022 9:38,0,Why does it chime? The app really should have a way to turn of the sound.
f114,Valdemar KJ,5,7/22/2022 19:34,0,Skåneland
f115,Ben Lewis,5,7/10/2022 13:48,0,Very helpful.

f255,A Google user,4,2/3/2020 7:41,0,"With Klarna it was possible to buy a ticket with a click.With Swedbank Pay I must click ""Select Payment"", press the saved card, and also fill in a code via SMS every time from Mastercard SecureCode.Why does SecureCode not think Swedbank is trusted?"
f256,A Google user,1,1/31/2020 18:55,0,Latest update deleted my card details :(
f257,A Google user,2,1/31/2020 15:54,0,It was believed that Skånetrafiken would succeed in something possibly.This app is not this.That I cannot pay with Swish removes the full simplicity of paying over the net.Imagine how with packing stressful pick up your mobile phone and when you finally press where to go (which the search function miraculously makes impossible sometimes) then you have to pick up your bank card to pay.This makes it so much smoother to just shit in Skånetrafiken and pay with SJ IST
f258,A Google user,3,1/30/2020 20:40,0,I don't seem to be able to configure the favorites
f259,A Google user,2,1/30/2020 11:20,0,Can't use this app because I can't buy tickets with Amex cards.would it be nice if the app also supported Amex card as a payment method

f263,A Google user,1,1/25/2020 22:08,2,Worst public transportation app & company. No other company would force all the users to go all digital with an mobile app. To make it even worse there is three apps available with three different price lists.
f264,A Google user,1,1/25/2020 14:31,0,Bad invoice system.
f265,A Google user,1,1/24/2020 13:01,0,Use the SJ app instead.This is the worst app you can find.

f267,A Google user,4,1/15/2020 11:01,7,Why not let me add unlimited favorites? I have more than 5 places that I travel to and from monthly. The favorite bar could easily be horizontally scrollable.
f268,A Google user,1,1/14/2020 10:44,6,"So bad user experience!The app is too complicated especially for the elderly or for those who are new!There is no user -friendliness in the app.You need to improve the app considerably, a way to do so by making it icon -based where you meet in the main page of icons for different functions with different colors.Buy now ticket should be blue, an active ticket should be green, an consumed ticket should be red, favorite destinations should be in your own view where you can easily add favorites!"
f269,A Google user,4,1/14/2020 8:14,1,"Hello!Think the app works well but would like to make two wishes.1. There should be a feature in the app where you can send suggestions for features or contact you directly about other support questions.2. You should be able to change so that if you have an active ticket, active ticket tab/page opens up when you start the app!Yes I know you can create a shortcut but with my suggestion you can, for example, start your app already from the screen lock on Samsung phones and end up directly on the ticket page."

Absurd. * Can't see itinerary when ticket is purchased. Have to search for the trip again. * Ticket is hidden 5 seconds after purchase for no good reason. * Once got an error message saying something went wrong. Tried again, same thing. 5 mins later I had two tickets. * Last used ticket is always displayed when openings the app, even if it was 1 month ago."

f279,A Google user,1,12/27/2019 12:36,2,"Worst experience in public transportation.... Payment doesn't really work, sometimes you pay the ticket several times then you have to get the money reimbursed... the scanners in the busses dont really work."
f280,A Google user,1,12/27/2019 10:47,12,Absolute con. I should have paid attention to the other reviews before downloading and using this app. Thought it would save me time at the station but instead I got charged for tickets that never materialised and had to queue at the station to pay again for a printed ticket. Absolutely disgraceful they can debit your card and there's nothing to show for it whatsoever
f281,A Google user,1,12/23/2019 8:18,0,Worst on everything.
f282,A Google user,1,12/22/2019 9:32,0,"This app shows neither delays nor the right timetables.If you buy a ticket without activating, that ticket activates anyway.Do not buy the ticket until you are sitting on the train.If the ticket via the app works normally, you get a fine of the inspector, because normally means that the ticket is wrong.I do not know what is worst, this app or Skånetrafiken in general."

There's no reason I wouldn't be able to choose invoice, but I can't, and for my sister it's the opposite: she cant choose card, only invoice. Would appreciate it if you could fix this."
f288,A Google user,1,12/16/2019 11:11,2,"Everything related to this company wreaks of disregard for their costumers! Thats what happens when u have a monopoly on buss transports in an entire region except for airports and other special buses. They onkt care about your money once they got that they dont care about you. The app is unreliable and rotten to the core just like their service. Walk , bike or other transportation if possible, avoid them like the plague!"
f289,A Google user,1,12/16/2019 8:55,5,this app has many problems... with ticket purchases... fetching the tickets... in summary not useful at all when you need it the most.
f290,A Google user,1,12/15/2019 14:45,0,Completely useless compared to the travel planner

f296,A Google user,3,12/12/2019 8:05,0,This app needs a widget that enables opening an active ticket with one touch.
f297,A Google user,3,12/11/2019 15:30,1,The app is fine but it desperately needs a dark theme.

f304,A Google user,1,12/9/2019 7:51,1,I dont know what you did in the latest update but the app doesnt even launch half the times any more. Fix it..
f305,A Google user,1,12/9/2019 7:23,3,"Times and cancellations are not always updated. Also, app does not always load, so have to plan extra time in order to buy ticket at stations."
f306,A Google user,1,12/9/2019 6:39,0,"Are you kidding me?I can't start the app, after it has auto updated itself, the only way to get the app again is to uninstall it and then log in again and all that.And not only that, it has not even saved my month's ticket for which I paid SEK 500+.Are they supposed to buy one for a month's ticket now just because your shit app can't work after update?"
f307,A Google user,3,12/8/2019 22:47,8,"Most of the time application is working fine, but twice I cannot open it and had to uninstall then reinstall the application to make it work, missed my bus once because of this, thank God the second time I had time to reinstall it before the bus comes. Hope you can fix this issue because it's crucial for the users to have this application always working especially now that you are transitioning on removing the physical travel cards."
f308,A Google user,2,12/8/2019 12:31,0,Sometimes it cannot start when You needed the most.

f321,A Google user,1,11/22/2019 17:05,0,I would just lend my ticket.In the new version I can't find it.I checked again and it was possible to lend then.Could it be that you are not immediately possible for the ticket to lend when you bought it?(In that case it is very impractical.)
f322,A Google user,5,11/21/2019 14:04,0,"Updated my review from 2 stars to 5 stars. Nothing to complain recently, specially when they added the vouchers 🙂👍🏽 The one who thought about the 4 hours limit for lending the ticket is definitely someone who never lived in Skåne. You can pass from east to west of Skåne in almost an hour. You can walk malmö in 4 hours. Do you know a word called (fair)?"

f324,A Google user,4,11/17/2019 15:31,0,Does what it says. No issues with weird permissions or huge use of data/cpu
f325,A Google user,4,11/15/2019 16:06,7,"You select the date and time you want and your destination, it returns the results and you pick one. The problem is when you select a trip to buy the ticket, the app completely ignores the time and date you selected and, by default, activates your ticket. This means that you'll only have until 4am of the following day to use the ticket. If you chose a future date, that is completely ignored and you'll need to buy another ticket. To solve this you can disable the ""activate"" button when buying the ticket but in my opinion this should be the default option, the ticket should just be disabled, then you never make mistakes. Why have the option to select date if it's just ignored later? (edit: I spoke with customer service and they are returning the money for the unused ticket. good service!)"
f326,A Google user,2,11/14/2019 23:37,0,"Disastrous in so many ways, boring and primitive UI especially compared to other public transport companies.And the payment methods are embarrassingly bad ...

f333,A Google user,1,11/3/2019 1:59,11,"After 3 years use, totally convinced that it's the worst ever public transport app. Has no idea what schedule means, reliability and accuracy are two last things they care about. Even with easy tech to update realtime schedule seems like rocket science for operators. The app and the service are completely independent, no relevancy for the info app has and the fact service runs. It's only for buying a ticket, rest info given is absolutely useless. Definitely need to improve on reliability !!"
f334,A Google user,2,10/30/2019 11:24,3,"Was working fine, then it forced me to update the app and everything is rubbish now! It's lagging, all the writing is much smaller and the payment method is overly complicated."

f344,A Google user,1,10/13/2019 19:08,0,"The app does not show a ticket after the purchase and shows an expired ticket instead, so it seems like the payment hasn't gone through.

f345,A Google user,4,10/11/2019 17:32,0,Works fine. - Would be nice if it opened the active ticket on boot - would make it faster to show ticket. - would also be handy if there was a auto-renew (with the options to renew on nearest work day and not only on expired) - Would also like to set custom lend out periods - there's is a big difference between 4 and 8 hours. Haven't checked if I can revoke it. So if I needed to lend it out for 6 hrs then I could do 8 hrs and revoke it after 6 hrs..
f346,A Google user,2,10/11/2019 6:02,0,Messy app;The active ticket quick menu doesn't work for me so it gets annoying very clicking to get the ticket.Thinking about returning to plastic card ticket;always available and no battery to be charged
f347,A Google user,2,10/10/2019 12:12,0,Currently the app is often complicated
f348,A Google user,2,10/7/2019 8:18,0,"Fine when it works, but morning commutes can be frustrating when the server goes on strike and you need to find a ticket machine. With the (cheaper) JoJo card being phased out one would expect a reliable replacement, not this rubbish."

Routes proposed are often worst to what you get when using Google Maps (arrive later, much longer walking distance), which I usually use before being a ticket due to more realistic walking times. The change in the payment method was rather annoying, I wish you could add Google Pay support."
f355,A Google user,1,9/26/2019 15:58,0,Activates ticket as default unvalidates this within 2 hours. No warnings given!!!!
f356,A Google user,3,9/26/2019 15:44,4,"The app is usually fine, but the last update broke it really bad, at least for my device (Oneplus 5T). Now it doesn't show any journey to Malmo from any street in Copenhagen which is not central station or the airport. Which would be tolerable, but then I can't buy the tickets with the credit card because the procedure fails at the end, so this makes the app useless. Is this a common issue or is it a problem on my end?"
f357,A Google user,1,9/25/2019 18:18,0,"Impossible to add cards, nothing better you press the button.What a fucking amateur building.Trains and bus today are almost impossible to go in Skåne, no alternative to the car because of this idiocy!"

f363,A Google user,1,9/3/2019 14:46,0,"Bad application, I am having problems in buying tickets, one of the cases that i had was buying a ticket outside the train in kastrup airport heading to malmö, beginning of last month, which led to me only being able to try and buy it on the train until its too late, and getting a fine, very frustrating process to go through now with skånetrafiken about this issue. Thanks"

f365,A Google user,4,8/21/2019 8:26,1,Intuitive and good GUI. But why does the app insist to get a social security number? And also to foreigners who need to register first on a website?
f366,A Google user,1,8/19/2019 23:48,1,"good with info and timetables, but can't purchase tickets or use any other functions, app has too many bugs. Reseplaneraren used to work but has the same issues as this one now. Basically only works for some people and only when it wants too"

f372,A Google user,2,7/26/2019 15:31,1,Overall good app. But I got confused about the expired and active tickets. When buying a new ticket it showed my old expired ticket. I thought some error happened and bought another ticket. This other ticket didn't show up either! I was lucky the controllant never showed up. Not until I got off the train and restarted the app the 2 active tickets were visible. I later found out that if this happens you need to go back to find you active tickets which I think if very unintuitive.
f373,A Google user,2,7/26/2019 12:56,1,Does not consider user experience much. Only has Klarna as payment option. Lengthy ToC for public service not ok. Not possible to purchase ticket advance of journey.

I didn't realize that the app was lagging until the train moved a few seconds later and I explained what happened to the conductor and I showed him that the app is still going in circles and suddenly it worked in front of him and the ticket got activated and he scanned it but he insisted and gave me a 1000 SEK fine anyway. My Internet connection was working good because I received email notifications while the app was just going in circles. The situation was humiliating and embarrassing and I ended up paying for your mistakes in the app. You should admit that your app has bugs and take responsibility for that, and you should fix it before slapping people with hefty fines! I demand a refund of the fine amount!"

And unfortunately there is no senior ticket yet (must continue with jojo card)."
f379,A Google user,4,6/27/2019 18:20,2,Good app. It would be nice to have configuration options to make it start showing the last valid ticket used and don't ask about turn on location each time. Some tickets are about 10% more expensive comparing with the JoJo card. I think it's unfair but I guess has nothting to do with the app.

I still think it's stupid that the Jojo-card grants you extra cheap tickets but the app doesn't. How does that make any sense? So for my monthly card the phone is best since the price is the same but for a single trip the card is vastly superior due to the 10% discount per trip. Crazy! Also let us use NFC for bliping in just like the oyster card in London. You use blip cards on the bus anyway.

f500,A Google user,2,1/15/2018 23:53,8,"Badly!Nice look, but definitely not what I need on the go;More favorites and a history list in the home screen.The last app put the commuter in focus, this puts the tourist in focus.The tourist has more time to go through maps and manually enter stops and addresses, unlike the commuter!The commuter uses the app to a greater extent also than the typical user who only buys tickets in the app ... The new development team PO should check out the older app - Watch and Learn, no shame to realize that the older one is better and that you just need to modernize it instead of replacing it ""with something brand new"" I have my monthly card in this app, and you may not have to use the app ...It would have been a good workaround for me as a commuter, although I have to create a new shortcut every month ..."
f501,A Google user,3,1/11/2018 15:07,1,Despite reviews this is a pretty good app. I've been waiting for it for a while. Having recently switched from iOS to Android I can say that the Android version needs some love.
f502,A Google user,3,12/28/2017 12:20,0,"Works OK except for the horrible usability problem that you cannot access your already bought tickets without clearing your latest search results. Really annoying when you need to switch trains or bus lines when going somewhere. This happens all the time for me at least.  When you search for a trip a floating action button shows at the bottom right with a ""buy ticket"" option, but when you already have one it should obviously give you the ""show ticket"" option instead. Or even better, like the add event button in the Google calendar app, the FAB could expand when you click it and show both options or maybe even one icon for each ticket if you happen to have more than one."

f512,A Google user,3,11/17/2017 18:36,3,Please fix smoother navigation between ticket and search.In the iOS app you can easily switch between the two while in this one must take 5 different steps and sought trip is not saved
f513,A Google user,3,11/14/2017 17:22,0,Fails sometimes on my 30day tickets.  Not even restart off the app will let the scanners  recognize the ticket. Which is bullcrap and leads to a pretty uncomfortable journey traveling and trying the scanner over and over. At least the Jojo cards don't fail.  It also seems like some drivers don't know how to handle the system in the bus itself. Just waving me past whenever they can't get it working.
f514,A Google user,2,11/13/2017 13:05,3,"Better, but much is missing.The most difficult thing is that you have to remove your search results to access the ticket, and that there are so many prints before the ticket comes up.Would be better that you could kind of swipe right to get a ticket directly and that your planning is not reset when you check your ticket, so that you still know where to show the ticket, especially if you have many changes.Can be a little tricky to look for everything, especially if you are in another place.The planning lacks many options, and often gives changes that you do not have time if a bus is for example two minutes by late.Thus, there are more buses to use than the app shows, and many that are not shown are better to take if, for example, you should switch to trains."

Also, stop bugging me to start location services!!! I don't want to waste battery and I know what bus stop I need. How many of your customers are actually completely oblivious to where they are?   Also, make it *obvious* when the departure time displayed has been affected somehow! If the bus is 10min late, it might catch up to its time table and when you show up at the time in the app, you're 10 min late!"
f535,A Google user,3,8/29/2017 9:18,1,Looks better but has less features. Why release an app that doesn't sell tickets for the biggest airport in the vicinity?
f536,A Google user,4,8/29/2017 7:09,0,Works well for my purposes. Works very well to buy 30 day periods. I still miss the old feature of saving predefined trips. I also miss a functionality to have a shortcut to your 30 day period ticket directly on the home screen. Quite a few clicks for being able to show your ticket..

f542,A Google user,3,7/31/2017 14:46,1,"""Corrected"" departure times never correct! I live at the first stop, so buses are mostly on time.

f543,A Google user,3,7/20/2017 13:37,2,"Would be useful if the app would give a reason why it cannot give out a ticket. Even better would be an option of a ticket to the leg of a trip that falls within Skåne, if the trip otherwise is stretching out to other counties. The fact that the app cannot buy a ticket to Kastrup is quite baffling. Hope it can be ironed out."

f545,A Google user,3,7/4/2017 13:44,3,"Now I have been waiting for improvements for a while and I was happy when I saw that you finally put in so that it should be possible to see if something has resigned!But does not see anything new obvious .. Think about whether the very subtle color the difference was there before?It is still too cumbersome to even produce their ticket.Still losing your search if you have to get the ticket.Give me a widget or shortcut, hell swipe from the right in any screen could have produced a pinned or last ticket, or swipe again for the next.Even better remove the drawer and run bottom navigation.It is easy to have bus cards on the mobile, but it is also much more frustrating when it is not possible to get the ticket faster than physical bus cards.Also think that when on a trip you see the stroke time cannot distinguish between delay and departure.Also think that time should always be in chronological order, ie if the bus resigned early then the time should be at the bottom as it does.If the bus departed late, the erased time should be at the top.When you press up so you see all stations you can't see if the bus departed from previous stops.Edit: Ellee so can you with the dot in filled?Which means that you cannot see when it departs from the other stops.For the time, only when the circle is filled.If the circle symbolizes departure, this needs to be uniform on the side before seeing your prey.There the destination circle is not filled in even if it has resigned/emerged.And the start the circle is filled with an icon.Either you need a UX or less focus on making it look so nice.It is difficult to get information quickly and easily.Without a difference between delay and departure, traveling with a change does not even get space without scroll on an S8."

f572,A Google user,1,4/6/2017 14:29,0,On my phone (samsung s4) the app would not allow me to buy any tickets. Just look at the different routes
f573,A Google user,1,4/5/2017 11:34,2,Please consider English speakers in mind. A lot of newcomers don't speak Swedish. Do it ASAP
f574,A Google user,2,4/4/2017 12:36,0,"Can't add the time in the calendar like last, does not stand how to add their bus card and mass is missing.Why not let us log in by account instead of number?"
f575,A Google user,2,4/2/2017 18:14,1,"There are some occasional things that are better in this than the previous app.However, the problem is that you have removed everything that was actually good about the last app.Isn't it easier to do a market research before you start developing?"
f576,A Google user,5,4/1/2017 19:43,0,Best
f577,A Google user,1,4/1/2017 10:07,3,The tickets are valid for way too short time! Did not have time to make my last connection within the validity of the ticket! Sometimes the qr code doesn't load and there's no way to scan the ticket
f578,A Google user,2,3/30/2017 23:50,0,"What do you do when you don't know the specific name of your destination? Or, beginning?"
f579,A Google user,4,3/30/2017 23:04,5,It's unfortunate that you can't view your ticket without removing the current search. Thus requiring you to re-search between each stop if you want to keep the time table in the phone.
f580,A Google user,1,3/30/2017 21:24,0,"The travel planner was much better, is this how my ticket money is wasted ????????????? !!"
f581,A Google user,3,3/30/2017 15:09,4,Need to be able to purchase tickets to CPH and Köpenhamn H. Otherwise it serves no purpose.
f582,A Google user,1,3/29/2017 18:28,0,"Prices are higher and the app is unmatched.You can't see more than two bus hours at a time and the map takes up too much space.I think it's bad that Duo can't buy.Also do not understand why you should pay more per ticket if you buy to 1 person than if you buy for 2, it does not work when you travel or train (with, for example, SJ)."
f583,A Google user,3,3/29/2017 17:15,2,Why can't I buy tickets from home to CPH ?? Good GUI but you forgot the essential thing ... To buy a ticket ...
f584,A Google user,2,3/29/2017 15:11,1,Significantly worse than the previous travel planner.Much less information about each departure and poor overview of different departures.Continued to use the excellent travel planner instead
f585,A Google user,3,3/29/2017 14:48,1,+ Stylish -It is more expensive than before it is thought that it says that you have a bigger discount.-It shows with trips where you have to go up to 500m.They are just hard to scroll by and have not found a setting on it.
f586,A Google user,2,3/28/2017 21:01,6,"Where is the real -time information?Where is the search history?Use the entire screen to display information instead of just air, preferably as compact as possible so you get an overview."
f587,A Google user,1,3/28/2017 16:46,0,Higher price on the monthly ticket for me as a student.
f588,A Google user,2,3/28/2017 15:34,0,Very bad
f589,A Google user,5,3/27/2017 21:24,1,Less cluttered than the old one. Good feel and I love that the app has support for buying 30 day ticket.
