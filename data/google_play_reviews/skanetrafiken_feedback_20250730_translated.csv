Men ser inget nytt uppenbart.. Fundera på om den väldigt subtila färg skillnaden fanns där innan? Det är fortfarande för omständigt att ens ta fram sin biljett. Tappar fortfarande sin sökning ifall man måste ta fram biljetten. Ge mig en widget eller genväg, hell swipa från höger i vilken skärm som helst hade kunnat ta fram en pinned eller senaste biljetten, eller swipa en gång till för nästa. Ännu bättre ta bort drawern och kör bottom navigation. Det är smidigt att ha busskort i mobilen men det är också bra mycket mer frustrerande när det inte går att få upp biljetten snabbare än fysiskt busskort. Tycker också att när man inne på en resa ser struken tid inte kan skilja på försening och avgång. Tycker också att tiden alltid borde stå i kronologisk ordning dvs om bussen avgick tidigt så borde strukna tiden stå nederst som det gör. Avgick bussen sent borde den strukna tiden vara överst. När man trycker upp så man ser alla stationer så kan man inte se om bussen avgått från tidigare hållplats. Edit: ellee så kan man det med pricken i fylld? Vilket betyder att man inte kan se när den avgår från andra hållplatserna. För tiden visas bara när cirkeln är ifylld. Ifall cirkel symboliserar avgång så behöver detta vara enhetligt på sidan innan där man ser sina byten. Där är destinations cirkeln ej ifylld även ifall den har avgått/kommit fram. Och start cirkeln är ifylld dock med en ikon. Antingen behöver ni en UX eller mindre fokus på att det ska se så snyggt ut. Det är svårt att få information snabbt och enkelt.

Think about whether the very subtle color the difference was there before?It is still too cumbersome to even produce their ticket.Still losing your search if you have to get the ticket.Give me a widget or shortcut, hell swipe from the right in any screen could have produced a pinned or last ticket, or swipe again for the next.Even better remove the drawer and run bottom navigation.It is easy to have bus cards on the mobile, but it is also much more frustrating when it is not possible to get the ticket faster than physical bus cards.Also think that when on a trip you see the stroke time cannot distinguish between delay and departure.Also think that time should always be in chronological order, ie if the bus resigned early then the time should be at the bottom as it does.If the bus departed late, the erased time should be at the top.When you press up so you see all stations you can't see if the bus departed from previous stops.Edit: Ellee so can you with the dot in filled?Which means that you cannot see when it departs from the other stops.For the time, only when the circle is filled.If the circle symbolizes departure, this needs to be uniform on the side before seeing your prey.There the destination circle is not filled in even if it has resigned/emerged.And the start the circle is filled with an icon.Either you need a UX or less focus on making it look so nice.It is difficult to get information quickly and easily.Without a difference between delay and departure, traveling with a change does not even get space without scroll on an S8.",Hello!It is gratifying that you have high expectations on the app and share what you think.The improvements that you mention are functions that several users demand and we take this into account when prioritizing the work.We ask you to continue using the app and look for news as we are continuously making releases./Joakim,,,
