f001,KevineN,1,6/30/2025 21:17,0,always late incompetent idiots
f002,Tobias Alm,1,6/30/2025 13:40,0,It works to blip with the mobile (not cracked screen) 1/5 times.Had driven with cards but it costs money for the plastic card itself.Pretty boring if you just have it for the summer card.
f003,Александр «al1k» Старостин,1,6/25/2025 11:20,0,can't register phone number can't pay without the number
f004,Jaume Adrover Forteza,1,6/19/2025 0:53,0,"The trains and buses are delayed or have some problem almost daily. The prices are way too high and make no sense. Even the app does funny things every few months. Sincerely, they only stay in business because they have monopoly."
f005,Teemu Jäntti,4,6/11/2025 5:11,0,Not bad at all. Great addition would be a widget that shows you directly the QR code of your chosen ticket.
f006,Simon,1,5/30/2025 11:35,0,A bug in the payment solution prevents me from paying by card.
f007,Aleksandr Gruzintsev,5,5/23/2025 9:56,3,"Very convenient app overall. Great job! The only bug(?) that irritates me a lot is the unpersonalized search. Scenario: I live in Malmö and never been in Ystad. I'm currently staying somewhere in Malmö and searching for the fastest way to Regementsgatan in the app (as I did previously many times), and the app suggests me a street with the same name in Ystad first."
f008,martin martin,1,4/28/2025 21:21,0,buss did not come
f009,[;',5,4/25/2025 19:02,0,Good and simple app with good features for those who want.Even better now with the new function to be able to see all departures (incl. Live) from a certain stop.
f010,Maxim Paymushkin,5,4/17/2025 15:29,2,"Please rectify the error with bus line 130. When looking for a trip from Lund Bankgatan to Malmö Värnhem, only buses from line 131 are displayed. There are also some strange alternatives with routes that are 2-3 km away, but not a single by bus 130."
f011,Marcelo Aguiar,3,4/15/2025 9:03,1,"Getting better, but last update made the live traffic function less usable. Now the app never remembers which bus I chose, so I have to select it every time I use it. Not so quick and practical anymore."
f012,{Debasis & Chayanika}Sarbajna,5,4/10/2025 7:41,0,wonderful
f013,Accede'To Vegan Drivers Rodnry Zaxxs Af Vegan,5,3/17/2025 22:54,0,"Excellente ,, Good for the climate , great staff , lots of information about schedules and delays , take time to learn but beats sitting in a car waiting for traffic"
f014,Frank,5,3/5/2025 17:23,0,Really najs💪
f015,Shell Uzo,1,3/1/2025 9:56,0,"When I have one or two bus replacements, I have to search for each exchange for each change because the entire search from the beginning only shows a exchange option while it is in reality possible to choose 2-3 buses most often.So you could have made the app smarter and show all possible changes.This is because you usually get fam to exchange bus stop earlier or later than scheduled time."
f016,Robert Adamson,1,1/30/2025 12:28,12,"Not showing correct departure time. When trains are delayed the information is shown to late, you have no chance to take an earlier train."
f017,Patrik Niklasson,5,1/23/2025 8:58,0,No issues so far!
f018,Liz,1,1/15/2025 8:30,1,"It sucks like really bad.... The workers are arrogant about everything when you ACCIDENTALLY push them (YES ACCIDENTALLY ITS SO BAD.. not everyone is like this luckily) and the trains are always so late and it's always construction on the ride or something, learn to do better cause this is useless. Apologized one time to one of the workers after accidentally pushing them AND THEY KEPT SPEAKING?? KEEP IT TO YOURSELF, I DON'T WANNA HEAR YO PROBLEMS ABOUT PEOPLE RIDING THE TRAINS...?? Embarrassing."
f019,Angel Rodriguez,4,12/28/2024 22:18,2,Generally works fine
f020,Albert Backenhof,5,12/18/2024 22:08,6,"It's ok for what it is supposed to do. Now please make it more user-friendly. For instance, add notification when long time ticket expires and make it possible to renew on long press. Update: this got fixed promptly, unlike my review"
f021,Kenneth Eriksson,2,11/19/2024 9:43,1,"A little sneaky that the ""Activate Now"" button is in exactly the same place as ""OK"" after purchase.You are welcome to do that better."
f022,carrorune,3,11/13/2024 11:56,2,"How come you still haven't fixed that you can see all departures from a stop?Not even when I turn on ""nearby stops"", both buses (which depart from the same stop) do.Extremely frustrating not to be able to plan their trip properly !!After trying almost all public transport apps, this is still the best.This and that you can see the buses in real time is the only reason there will be 3 stars."
f023,Morten Østerlund Jørgensen,1,10/30/2024 18:17,0,Extremely lazy staff. They don't want to check tickets and just walk very fast through the train
f024,Aubrey Dilson,3,10/21/2024 8:01,1,I'm not sure where I can comment about the busses and not the app but the buss drivers never wait for you even when it's 1 second. I get they want to be on time but waiting a second should not be a big problem otherwise I think the app is very good when it comes to directions.
f025,Alessio Curri,1,10/14/2024 22:47,2,Why do you need my mobile number to be able to buy a train ticket? Spam much?
f026,Thomas N,1,10/11/2024 14:51,0,Scan QR code very often fails in the buses.Why not use NFC!🤦vir
f027,Andrea Villalobos,4,10/9/2024 12:14,1,"The best cost/benefit way to take public transport in the Scandinavian region. So just needs to improve in the options of moving in the map, especially in the walking way part."
f028,Clara D'Andrea,1,9/26/2024 21:53,0,"I only gave this app one star cuz I dont know how to give it a half.... if i could give it minus, I would. Lol just got back here to give it 1 star again cuz I forgot i already gave it"
f029,Christian Gylling,1,9/22/2024 15:11,1,"Can't buy a ticket, tough, lots of error messages.Customer service had no solution."
f030,Dilshan Weerathunga,4,9/1/2024 19:30,1,"My first impression of the app isn’t good because there’s no bottom navigation bar or hamburger menu. When I press the device's back button, a location selection alert appears instead. I think this needs to be changed."
f031,Niloofar Asadi zaki,1,8/5/2024 13:04,0,"When I tried to register my number I got the below error message: Oops, something went wrong! Contact customer service for more information."
f032,Vincent Videve,1,8/1/2024 23:18,0,Nothing wrong with the app but Skånetrafiken can pull somewhere
f033,2H2,2,7/5/2024 12:15,0,Mid
f034,Adam Nadolny,5,6/4/2024 18:06,2,"Great app, first time in Malmö and this app was really helpful for commuting from start to finish of my trip (CPH airport to Malmo and around the city). Thanks!"
f035,Jace,1,5/23/2024 15:49,1,"Not only does the app not say when the transportation is late or even cancelled, but it also doesn't accurately depict the best course of action to get from point A to point B. You just gotta pray you get a good driver or the buss won't even pick you up at the stops outside town."
f036,Mauricio Marin Jimenez,1,5/20/2024 8:20,0,It gets dumber and dumber with each update
f037,Anders Blomdell,1,4/8/2024 13:09,0,"Almost never can to scan the ticket on buses, perhaps because of too small QR code"
f038,Ludvig Mäki,1,3/30/2024 9:43,0,Can't buy a ticket.States that you have to be 18 years old.Stands that you can pay when you are 7-18 years ...
f039,Sara Bearnaise,2,3/18/2024 12:54,0,"Fit with the ticket on the phone, the app is something better at searching for trips with many changes than before.Sad to have to seek information about delays through the Swedish Transport Administration if you want correct info, Skånetrafiken's app/web rarely shows right.I get notification when the monthly ticket expires but not for the trips I follow.When I want to follow an event in the app, I get a message ""Null/Nnull"".The app is allowed to send all notes, even when the phone is in disturbing no position, does not work."
f040,Marcus Holmström,1,3/13/2024 7:57,0,"The worst public transport company in Sweden.Be careful and seek each sub -trip separately, otherwise incorrect suggestions will send you in the wrong direction.Otherwise, the fare is constantly increasing, bus lines are withdrawn and departures become fewer and fewer, especially outside big cities.Skånetrafiken does not deserve tax assets to finance its failed business."
f041,hasuchobogosu,1,2/20/2024 19:14,3,Is not accurate with delays. Will change time even if there is no delay then won't correct it until after it departed. Besides that really all Skånetrafikens services are at best a 2/10 and the prices are outrageous considering it's all paid by taxpayers.
f042,David,1,2/4/2024 14:07,0,"The ticket system is disastrously lousy and it is clear that Skånetrafiken is only trying to make more and more money on public transport.Tickets will be more expensive, the bus chafs will be unpleasant and both buses and trains are only more delayed."
f043,Tage Henningsson,4,1/29/2024 8:49,1,"Good for getting around if one needs, better than Blekinges"
f044,Chris Johansson,4,1/22/2024 8:50,1,"What did you do with the filtering in the search?Finding all options for commuting between Malmö and Helsingborg is no longer going.There are both Pågatåg and Öresund train that go to the same destinations but you filter one or the other?Where is the option that gives me both the fastest train and the trains that happen to take 5min longer?Fix your search results, filters are a choice not a preset and you set something so set to show everything.Thanks for the fix, now works :)"
f045,jo ke,2,1/19/2024 14:40,1,"I travell between Höör and Malmö and have lost half of my train options since the new time table came in December 2023. I have changed the filter when searching in the app but I still only get half of the available train departures. Pls fix! Hi Linus, thanks for the reply! It seems like the issues is fixed from Höör >> Malmö. But not the other way around. Could you please look into it? Thanks!"
f046,Robin Karlsson,1,1/2/2024 17:46,4,"Terribly designed app. I bought a ticket for a specific time and then a pop up asks me immediately after purchase if I want to activate my ticket, doing so invalidated it for the time I specified in the first step. Had to buy an additional ticket due to poor design."
