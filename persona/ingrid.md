## Ingrid Henke, 73 years old, pensioner -- "I only drive the car if I have to"

### About Ingrid

Ingrid is a retired nurse and has lived with her husband in her house for over 30 years. Routines are important to her, e.g. every Tuesday and Saturday she takes the bus to the market. Ingrid is reluctant to go by car because she has problems with her eyes. Ingrid has a moderate visual impairment, which makes it difficult for her to read small text, low-contrast content, or signage in poor lighting. She is also deuteranomalous (a form of red-green color blindness), which means she has trouble distinguishing green shades from red, especially when used in maps, digital UIs, or real-time information boards. When shopping or going on excursions with her grandchildren, her husband usually drives. Ingrid is a native Swedish speaker and fluent in English.
